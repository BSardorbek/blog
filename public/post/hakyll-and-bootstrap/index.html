<p>Though I&rsquo;ve run a few <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" title="WordPress">Wordpress</a> sites in the past, I&rsquo;ve always found the
software irritating to use.
<label for="mn-update-failure" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-update-failure" class="margin-toggle">
<span class="marginnote">
    <em>Update:</em> 
It's probably no surprise, but diving
straight into Haskell wasn't the smoothest transition; without a better
understanding of the language as a whole, I spent more time fiddling with the
code than writing. I experimented with a few different site generation tools,
including a custom Python script, before settling on Steve Francia's <a
href="http://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo: A Fast & Modern Static Website
Generator">Hugo</a>.

</span>

In particular, I <em>loathe</em> the composer&mdash;the rich text editor never works quite
as I expect it to, and the HTML editor mangles my markup without warning. The
installation is dead simple, the theme support is fantastic, and I love <a href="http://ma.tt/tag/gpl/" title="Matt Mullenweg on the GPL">Matt
Mullenweg&rsquo;s support of free software</a>, but Wordpress just isn&rsquo;t for me.
At the same time, I don&rsquo;t miss hand-coding entire sites; I&rsquo;ve done that exactly
twice, and maintaining scads of duplicated markup is a nightmare I don&rsquo;t care
to repeat.  Since I&rsquo;m starting this site with a clean slate, I have the luxury
of choosing whatever tools I like; after looking at everything from <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal">Drupal</a>
to <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/" title="Tumblr">Tumblr</a>, I decided to keep things simple and build with <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/" title="Hakyll">Hakyll</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hakyll-static-site-generation">Hakyll: Static Site Generation</h2>

<p>Hakyll is a static site generator, which means that it&rsquo;s only a few short steps
away from writing markup by hand. Those few steps make all the difference,
though&mdash;I can still control exactly what the final HTML will look
like, but Hakyll lets me write articles in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> and use templates for
site-wide elements like navigation and footers.  Static sites are all the rage
among geeks these days, so <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/1-introduction/" title="Nanoc Documentation">a lot&rsquo;s</a> already <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/01/moving-from-django-to-hyde/" title="Steve Losh: Moving from Django to Hyde">been written</a>
about their technical advantages.  In short, static sites are:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast by default, even on inexpensive hardware;</li>
<li>immune to many common security exploits;</li>
<li>easily saved and versioned; and</li>
<li>editable offline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly for me, Hakyll is comfortable. I can write templates and posts
in <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/" title="Steve Losh: Coming Home to Vim">vim</a>, keep versions and branches in <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git">git</a>, and generally work with
whatever text manipulation tools make me happy. Hakyll even comes with a
built-in webserver, so it&rsquo;s easy to see a live preview of any changes I&rsquo;m
making. Since writing on this site is supposed to be a fun side project,
comfortable tools are priority zero.</p>

<p>Building a site without a database isn&rsquo;t all roses and puppies, though. There&rsquo;s
no easy way for me to include an automated &ldquo;Popular Posts&rdquo; widget in the
sidebar, for example, and any future search widgets will need to rely on an
external search engine. Most importantly, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to store and
manage reader comments. Services like <a href="http://disqus.com" title="Disqus">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://intensedebate.com" title="IntenseDebate">IntenseDebate</a> offer
easy Javascript-based workarounds, but I&rsquo;ll need to do a little more due
diligence before I&rsquo;m comfortable trusting them with critical data.</p>

<p>Hakyll also has its own set of challenges, mostly because it&rsquo;s written and
configured in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell" title="HaskellWiki">Haskell</a>. To put it mildly, I&rsquo;m a Haskell neophyte&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
interested in the language for months, but haven&rsquo;t done anything more than a
few <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a> questions. Since I don&rsquo;t have a strong background in
category theory, monads and arrows are <em>blowing my mind</em>.  There&rsquo;s something
really amazing and elegant going on, but I&rsquo;m only catching glimpses of it
between compiler errors. Nevertheless, the Hakyll <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials.html" title="Hakyll Tutorials">documentation</a>
is excellent, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hakyll" title="Hakyll Google Group">mailing list</a> is active, and the
<a href="http://jaspervdj.be" title="Jasper Van der Jeugt">author</a> is exceptionally helpful, so my first foray into practical
functional programming has been more enlightening than infuriating.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrap-clean-design-no-fuss">Bootstrap: Clean Design, No Fuss</h2>

<p>I have trouble matching my clothing, let alone the dozens of small elements
that make up a website, so creating an attractive design for my new site was a
daunting task. Luckily, nobody needs to see my first efforts&mdash;I decided to use
Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> framework instead. It&rsquo;s clean, attractive, and
mobile-friendly, and it&rsquo;s teaching me some of HTML5&rsquo;s new tricks.
<a href="http://lesscss.org" title="{less}">{less}</a>, the CSS meta-language Boostrap uses, is also
wonderful: it&rsquo;s close enough to vanilla CSS that it&rsquo;s easy to
learn, but it makes my stylesheets much more modular and consistent.</p>

<p>While I haven&rsquo;t tweaked Bootstrap&rsquo;s default styling much, I <em>had</em> to do
something about the fonts. I like Helvetica, especially on visually intense
marketing sites&mdash;but Bootstrap&rsquo;s tiny default font size combined with
Helvetica&rsquo;s clinical modernism made blocks of text downright hostile. After a few
hours poking through <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" title="Google Web Fonts">Google Web Fonts</a> and testing different styles,
I settled on <a href="http://www.omnibus-type.com/" title="Omnibus Type">Omnibus Type&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Rosario" title="Rosario">Rosario</a>. To my eye, it
manages to be a little more playful and human than Helvetica without
distracting from the words themselves.</p>

<p>My efforts to choose a different color scheme, though, have been a complete
failure. The defaults are nice enough, but they lack soul, and my efforts to
change them usually end in a neon-tinted nightmare. There&rsquo;s hope on the
horizon, though&mdash;I just read Ian Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/" title="Design Tip: Never User Black">Never Use Black</a>,&rdquo;
and I may try mixing some blue or red into the default grays.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not much of a programmer or a designer, so I&rsquo;m always in the market for
suggestions! If coding&rsquo;s your thing, take a look at the <a href="http://github.com/akshayjshah/akshayjshah.github.io">source code on
GitHub</a>; otherwise, send
me a <a href="http://twitter.com/akshayshah">tweet</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
