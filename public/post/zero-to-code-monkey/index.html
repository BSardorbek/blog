<article>
  

<p>Last year, I&rsquo;d never have called myself a programmer. Sure, I&rsquo;d dabbled a bit
here and there: I took a few computer science courses in high school and
college, cobbled together some Excel macros and one-off data processing scripts
in medical school, and hand-wrote two websites in the late 90s. I&rsquo;d never
written code daily, even while taking computer science classes, and most
importantly, I&rsquo;d never collaborated on a software project. At best, I was a
dilettante.</p>

<p>Nine months later, I&rsquo;m on a different plane: I&rsquo;m still no expert, but I&rsquo;m
definitely a programmer (or at least a code monkey). Writing code every day is
an important part of my job, and I <em>love</em> it. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning
to code, especially in Python, I hope my story helps you get started faster.
If you&rsquo;re an experienced engineer, leave a comment and tell me where I went
wrong (and where I should go next)!</p>

<h2 id="syntax-is-easy">Syntax Is Easy</h2>

<p>Oddly enough, learning the syntax of a programming language &mdash; the rules
for assembling words, curly braces, backslashes, and all the other
typographical flotsam in the corners of your keyboard into working code &mdash;
was relatively easy. <a href="http://www.python.org/about/">Python</a> is particularly straightforward, and Zed Shaw&rsquo;s
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> taught me the basics in a single weekend.
Experimenting in an <a href="http://repl.it/" title="repl.it">interactive environment</a> was very helpful at this
stage, since the interpreter caught all my mistakes, printed a helpful error
message, and let me try again right away. Whenever I didn&rsquo;t understand where
I&rsquo;d gone wrong, pasting the error message verbatim into Google always turned up
a relevant answer.</p>

<p>Only a few days in, I was able to exercise my new skills by writing a to-do
manager like <a href="http://stevelosh.com/projects/t/">Steve Losh&rsquo;s t</a> &mdash; and it <em>actually worked</em>.  Writing
even a simple utility that functioned exactly as I wanted it to was hugely
empowering, and using my little program every day kept me excited about
learning. Emulating t had an unanticipated, but immensely helpful, side effect:
it let me compare my efforts to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sjl/t/src/">the actual t source code</a>, which is
also written in Python. Taking the time to really understand how Steve&rsquo;s code
worked (and why it was much, much better than mine) accelerated my learning
dramatically.</p>

<h2 id="computer-science-is-practical">Computer Science Is Practical</h2>

<p>Of course, what&rsquo;s a to-do manager without projects, sub-projects, and maybe
even sub-sub-projects? Naively, I assumed that adding this feature to my little
utility would be a quick one-hour project. When I sat down to start
writing, though, I realized that I had no clue how to handle potentially
infinite project nesting. A little research (leavened with some hazy memories
from school) revealed that managing data with this sort of parent-child
relationship is, unsurprisingly, a well-studied problem in computer science,
and after a few nights of experimenting and reading I managed to add projects
to my to-do list manager.</p>

<p>Along the way, I realized that I&rsquo;d always be a few steps behind until I learned
some basic computer science: most common problems have established solutions,
and my complete ignorance of those solutions was forcing me to reinvent the
wheel (poorly) at every turn. It&rsquo;s a little like trying to organize thousands
of loose papers without using a file cabinet; I&rsquo;d probably come up with some
sort of workable system eventually, but why go through all that pain when
there&rsquo;s a good solution that&rsquo;s widely available? To push the analogy
further, file cabinets also have a large ecosystem of standard add-ons
designed to solve particular problems &mdash; it&rsquo;s easy to get cabinets with
built-in indexing systems, horizontal drawers, or wheels, for example.
Similarly, it&rsquo;s easy to find variations of the basic computer science building
blocks that are optimized for particular applications.</p>

<p>Nine months isn&rsquo;t enough to make anyone an expert in computer science, but
there are a <em>lot</em> of excellent courses available free online. I started with
MIT&rsquo;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</a> because it&rsquo;s
taught in Python, doesn&rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge, and moves slowly enough
for me to watch while riding the train and keeping an eye out for my stop. I&rsquo;m
not sure what I&rsquo;ll tackle next, but I&rsquo;m leaning towards continuing the MIT
undergraduate sequence. (Have a suggestion? Leave a comment and let me know!)</p>

<h2 id="craftsmanship-is-crucial">Craftsmanship Is Crucial</h2>

<p>A few days after I started watching the MIT lectures, I switched jobs and began
writing code at work. This was, to say the least, a big transition: I went from
being the sole author of a hundred-line program to working with a team of real
engineers building a real web application. The standard for the correctness of
my code went up, but more importantly, so did the standards for its
<em>readability</em> and <em>maintainability</em>.</p>

<p>Even with reams of well-written code (and the inevitable bits of crufty legacy
code) to learn from, it took me months to really understand why anyone would
prioritize anything other than accurate output. &ldquo;It works right now,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d think to
myself, &ldquo;so why would anyone spend another week just making it look pretty?&rdquo;
That attitude changed the first time I had to add some functionality to a small
piece of code I&rsquo;d written a few months earlier. Even as the original author, I
was completely baffled &mdash; I&rsquo;d named every variable <code>x</code>, <code>sbgs</code>,
<code>data</code> (yes, really), or something equally useless, and now I couldn&rsquo;t make
heads or tails of any of it. I ended up scrapping the whole file, starting from
scratch, and feeling lucky that none of the many bugs in my old code had seen
the light of day.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;m now a convert. I&rsquo;m getting better at giving functions and
variables meaningful names. I plan my code more carefully. I&rsquo;m a little more
comfortable with object-oriented programming, and I&rsquo;m keeping global variables
to a minimum. More abstractly, I&rsquo;m slowly learning how to hide complexity so
that other people can treat my code as a pluggable component. I want to take
pride not just in my code&rsquo;s functionality, but in its readability, its
cleanliness, and its aesthetics &mdash; in short, in its craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Taking a few months to focus on something other than basic computer science is
a luxury I can afford only because Python provides an off-the-shelf version of
most common building blocks. Since I don&rsquo;t absolutely need to know, for
example, how each of the many common sorting algorithms works (though it would
probably be helpful), I can afford to put reading on hold for a little while to
become a better craftsman. I&rsquo;ve spent most of this time reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670">Code
Complete</a>, mostly because Jeff Atwood describes it as &ldquo;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/recommended-reading-for-developers.html">the Joy of Cooking
for software developers</a>.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll probably still make the same
rookie mistakes, but I hope that this early investment will help me learn from
my mistakes faster.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll finish Code Complete this week, but I&rsquo;m not sure where I should invest my
time next. I could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Review linear algebra. I&rsquo;m hoping to pick up a few machine learning projects
soon, so dusting off my math skills would be helpful.</li>
<li>Start another computer science course or read an introductory book on data
structures and algorithms. Along with learning more math, this is probably
the best long-term use of my time.</li>
<li>Learn the Python numerical toolkit in more depth. This is definitely the most
practical option, but I think it has the least enduring value.</li>
<li>Read more about software craftsmanship and project management. I have copies
of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, but I&rsquo;m
inclined to focus more on hard skills for the next few months.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, I&rsquo;d appreciate your input! Leave a comment and let me
know how you&rsquo;d proceed.</p>
