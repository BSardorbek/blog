(Rather than my usual notes, this more of a retrospective on a cookbook I've
read many times.)

I bought Mark Bittman's [How to Cook
Everything](https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Recipes-Anniversary/dp/0764578650/)
fifteen years ago, when I moved to Nashville and started medical school. It's a
*fantastic* all-in-one kitchen reference: it covers ingredients, techniques,
tools, and recipes. Most chapters include some general notes on prepping and
cooking each ingredient, and the recipes usually highlight different approaches
and cuisines. For years, I'd go to the grocery on the weekend, buy a few cheap,
seasonal ingredients, and cook one recipe each night. Cooking the same
ingredients in different ways---and returning to favorite recipes often---built
my confidence in the kitchen.

These days, I leaf through the book when I'm in a cooking rut, but I rarely use
the recipes. Because they prioritize approachability, the final product falls
far short of more ambitious recipes from Cook's Illustated, the Food Lab, or a
specialized book or blog. In my kitchen, How to Cook Everything is a victim of
its own success: Bittman's approach to food is how I improvise, so my standards
for recipes are now higher.

I still gift this book to new cooks, hoping that they'll eventually outgrow it.
