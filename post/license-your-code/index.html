  <h1>License Your Code!</h1>

<article>
  

<p>If you&rsquo;re a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> (or <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, or <a href="http://www.gitorious.com">Gitorious</a>) user, you probably
want to let other people use your code in their own projects. Just throwing
your code online isn&rsquo;t enough, though &ndash; you <em>have</em> to release it under an
open-source license.  If you&rsquo;re not sure why, read on: in this post, I&rsquo;ll
explain the absolute minimum that every developer should know about copyright
and software licensing.</p>

<p>Even though <abbr title="I Am Not a Lawyer">IANAL</abbr>, I&rsquo;ll start with a few
disclaimers: this post isn&rsquo;t legal advice, I&rsquo;m not going to address patents at
all, and some of what I&rsquo;m about to explain is specific to the United States.</p>

<h2 id="closed-by-default">Closed by Default</h2>

<p>In the US, every shred of code you&rsquo;ve ever written is automatically protected
by copyright. That means, broadly speaking, that it&rsquo;s your property.  If you
leave your bike unlocked outside a coffee shop, I&rsquo;m not allowed to walk by and
steal it; similarly, if you post your code online, I&rsquo;m not automatically
allowed to copy and use it. Don&rsquo;t worry, though &ndash; seventy years after you die,
the copyright expires and your code enters the <em>public domain</em>, at which point
I can finally use it however I like.</p>

<p>Under American law, it&rsquo;s very difficult to reliably circumvent the century-long
wait before your copyright expires. To let other developers legally copy,
modify, and reuse your code while it&rsquo;s still relevant, you have to offer it to
them under a <em>license</em>.</p>

<h2 id="permissive-licensing">Permissive Licensing</h2>

<p>Licenses are just agreements between you, the author and owner of the code, and
all the other developers who&rsquo;d like to use your code. Even if you&rsquo;ve never
exchanged emails or chatted on the phone, you can sue developers who use your
code but don&rsquo;t follow the rules in your license.</p>

<p>Some open-source software licenses are quite straightforward: they let other
developers do whatever they&rsquo;d like with your code as long as they don&rsquo;t hold
you liable for the consequences. They can package your library into a
closed-source application and sell subscriptions, they can modify the code and
distribute it under a different license, and they can even sell copies of your
code without changing a single line. If your code has a bug that causes a
nuclear meltdown, though, they&rsquo;re on their own. Because they let other
developers do whatever they&rsquo;d like, these licenses are often called
<em>permissive</em>; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a> is a popular example.</p>

<h2 id="copyleft">Copyleft</h2>

<p>But what if you don&rsquo;t want your code integrated into closed-source systems?
Richard Stallman and the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> are right there with
you. In a clever legal hack, they wrote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL</a>, a license which lets other
developers run, read, change, and share your source code, but requires that any
copies (modified or not) be licensed in a way that preserves the same freedoms.
Licensing your work under the GPL allows other people to integrate your code
into a paid product, but it forces them to license their product under the GPL,
too (or something that&rsquo;s essentially identical). In short, your code and all
its descendants will be free forever, but many companies won&rsquo;t be willing to
use it. Because it uses a copyright hack to attack the very notion of
software ownership, the GPL and its variants are often called <em>copyleft</em>
licenses.</p>

<p>And with that, you know more than 99% of programmers about software licensing.
Stand proud, grasshopper, and remember to include an explicit license when
sharing your code online.</p>

<h2 id="more-questions">More Questions?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Need a refresher? Looking for some actual legalese to include in your
project? Check out GitHub&rsquo;s <a href="http://choosealicense.com/">license picker</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Want to know more about intellectual property and open source? Read Richard
Stallman&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html">Why Software Should Not Have Owners</a>. It&rsquo;s a seminal
piece, and it&rsquo;s well worth your time.</p></li>

<li><p>Wondering why most folks these days call it &ldquo;open-source&rdquo; and not &ldquo;free&rdquo;
software? Read Eric Raymond&rsquo;s <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/open-source.html">1998 call to action</a>. While
you&rsquo;re there, you may want to check out <a href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.
(Ignore anything related to guns, sex, or politics.) For Stallman&rsquo;s response,
read <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Curious how all this copyright stuff relates to software patents? It&rsquo;s
complicated. Patents aren&rsquo;t the same thing as copyright, though some
open-source licenses attempt to address them. Think of patent protection as
another axis that&rsquo;s orthogonal to the permissive-copyleft axis. If you know
of a good summary article, leave a comment!</p></li>
