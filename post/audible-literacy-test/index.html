        <p>If it takes someone more than 20 years to notice how to properly use &ldquo;it&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
then that&rsquo;s not a learning curve I&rsquo;m comfortable with. So, even in this
hyper-competitive market, I will pass on a great programmer who cannot
write.</p>

<p>Especially among technical folks, writing is an underrated skill. Kyle Wiens
hit the front page of Hacker News by blogging about his use of a writing test
to screen engineering applicants; while I&rsquo;m not completely convinced that &ldquo;at
its core, code is prose,&rdquo; I do believe that facility with prose is both
valuable in itself and a good proxy for attention to detail. Many authors have
made the former point, often <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2012/04/the-dirty-dozen-grammatical-er.php">specifically addressing startups</a>, and Kyle
himself does an excellent job making the latter connection. However, not all of
us are willing (or allowed) to administer a writing test as part of the
interview process. For the rushed curmudgeon, I offer a shortcut: focus on the
candidate&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="an-easy-audible-grammar-test">An Easy, Audible Grammar Test</h2>

<p>Many guides to grammar gaffes focus on homophones&ndash;pairs of words that
have different meanings but identical pronunciations.  But relying on
homophones to sort the literate wheat from the unemployable chaff is difficult
precisely because they sound alike; using homophones to detect your candidate&rsquo;s
illiteracy requires a written test.  (The most obliging candidates display
their ignorance in a resume or cover letter, but not everyone is so
forthright.) Focusing on &ldquo;myself&rdquo; avoids this trap, since misuse is easily
flagged in speech and in writing.</p>

<p>Like &ldquo;whom,&rdquo; &ldquo;myself&rdquo; is tricky because correct usage demands some knowledge of
formal grammar. It&rsquo;s only appropriate in two cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the speaker is both the subject and the object of a verb, e.g., &ldquo;Oops, I must have
sent that email to myself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>When used for emphasis, e.g., &ldquo;I fixed that bug myself.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to be suspicious of any sentence that includes &ldquo;myself&rdquo;
but not &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Most importantly, &ldquo;myself&rdquo; is <em>not</em> just a fancy substitute for &ldquo;me&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I.&rdquo; These are two incorrect, but sadly common, constructions:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Feel free to bring up any concerns with Bob or myself.&rdquo; (Replace with &ldquo;Bob
or me.&ldquo;)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Jane and myself will go to the meeting.&rdquo; (Replace with &ldquo;Jane and I.&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it&ndash;a simple, audible grammar test. Its
false-positive rate is low, and it&rsquo;s particularly good at detecting the overly
self-important candidate (or co-worker).</p>
