# Methi Murgh, Dhaba-Style

A traditional approach, direct from my mother-in-law.

## Ingredients

For the marinade:

* 1 c yogurt
* 1 tbsp ground coriander seed
* 1/2 tsp chile powder (pure peppers, *not* the Mexican spice blend)
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 2 bay leaves
* 2--3 green cardamom pods
* 2 black cardamom pods
* 3--4 whole cloves
* 1--2 strands of mace
* 2--3 small pieces of cinnamon
* 1 tbsp ghee
* salt to taste

Remaining ingredients:

* 8--10 pieces of bone-in chicken
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3--4 cloves of garlic
* 2 inches peeled ginger
* 4--6 green chiles
* 1 small bowl chopped methi
* 1 small bowl methi leaves
* 1 c cream
* chopped cilantro leaves (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Grind the spices, toast them in the ghee, whisk the resulting paste into the
   yogurt, and salt to taste. Marinade the chicken for 30m.
2. Grind the chopped onion, garlic, and half the ginger and chiles. Saute the
   resulting masala until the raw smell is gone (3--4 minutes).
3. Add both bowls of methi and cook for another 3--4 minutes.
4. Add the chicken and marinade, stir, and cook at a bare simmer until chicken
   is just shy of tender (6--8 minutes).
5. Slit remaining green chiles and julienne remaining ginger. Add chiles,
   ginger, and cream, then cook until chicken is tender (2--3 minutes).
6. Adjust seasoning, then garnish with chopped cilantro leaves.

## Notes

* In English, methi is fenugreek. I've only seen methi in Indian recipes, so it
  always takes me a few minutes to remember the translation.
* Methi is easy to grow in San Francisco. Fresh methi tastes very different
  from dried (kasoori) methi.
